== Test for transmit times in n nodes

Capture transmission on n boards. 1 channel to 1 pin toggling on transmission done.

=== How to use the test

Run in console: `python trickle_test_n_nodes.py [capture-seconds] [Imin] [Imax] [nodes-amount]`

=== How the test works



=== Issues
* The Trickle part of the test does not have insight into the reset of the interval to Imin.
The test therefore assumes that the interval has been reset if it detects a transmission gap
`imin / 2 <= transmission_gap < imin + last_interval / 2` and adapts accordingly,
potentially missing out on detecting an error.

* If the duration between the first two transmissions is not in the Imin interval,
the Trickle validation method `transmits_in_trickle` will not pass any durations until the interval is reset to Imin.
This can be checked by looking at the array returned by the validation method,
as the first indexes from the test will have failed the test.
