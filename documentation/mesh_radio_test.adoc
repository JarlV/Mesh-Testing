= Test for radio uptime and radio transmission using the Trickle algorithm

The test for radio uptime is based on the `READY` and `DISABLE` events.
The input for the test is a `Logic Saleae` capture file from the two pins signifying the
mentioned radio events, with `READY` as LSB.

The test also reads what trickle instance a transmission is for, keeping track of the transmission timing for each instance (maximum 16) separately and validating the timing with respect to the Trickle algorithm.

The capture data is imported automatically by the script
if the steps listed below are followed.

== How to use the test

|===
|Logic line |Node output pin

|0
|READY event toggle

|1
|DISABLE event toggle

|2-5
|4 bits used as instance ID
|===
. Have the `Logic analyzer` lines [0-5] connected to a node in the mesh as shown in the table above.
. Have the mesh nodes running.
. Run the Python script link:../mesh_radio_test.py[`mesh_radio_test.py`]
along with the the desired capture length in seconds,
the Trickle Imin and Imax values used in the mesh code
and the amount of nodes in the mesh
`python mesh_radio_test.py [capture-seconds] [Imin] [Imax] [nodes-amount]`.

The Logic capture should begin, printing out `capturing... (x seconds)`,
followed by the results of the test.

=== Dependencies

* Logic Analyzer
* link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/saleae[Python Saleae]
* link:https://matplotlib.org/[Python matplotlib]
* link:../logicData.py[logicData] (located in the repository)

== How the test works

The script identifies the time between a
`READY` event and a `DISABLE` event as the radio being active.
The test also distinguishes between `Tx` and `Rx` by the *value* (high or low) of the pin signifying `READY`
at the time of a `DISABLE` event.

=== Radio up time

* If the bit for READY is `*1*`, the time from the toggle of READY to the toggle of
DISABLE is added to the total *`Rx`* time.
* If the bit for READY is `*0*`, the time from the toggle of READY to the toggle of
DISABLE is added to the total *`Tx`* time.

At the end of the test, the sum of the radio uptime is compared to the total capture time,
and a percentage for radio up time in Rx and Tx mode is printed to console.

=== Trickle transmission



== Issues

* A issue that was discovered with the Logic capture is that it sometimes contain `20 ns` toggles.
This has been taken into consideration in the Python script by ignoring
durations between toggles that is less than `1 us`.

* The Trickle part of the test does not have insight into the reset of the interval to Imin.
The test therefore assumes that the interval has been reset if it detects a transmission gap
`imin / 2 <= transmission_gap < imin + last_interval / 2` and adapts accordingly,
potentially missing out on detecting an error.
