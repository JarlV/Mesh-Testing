= Test scripts for the mesh implementation on PhoenixLL

== Introduction
Included in this repository are several tests for the radio behaviour
in a mesh of n nodes or single nodes.

The tests were used in the group project `IT2901` on a BLE mesh impolementation using
`PhoenixLL` and the `Trickle algorithm`.
